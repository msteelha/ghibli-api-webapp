# Studio Ghibli API Webapp
This project showcases a React webapp that pulls information from the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) and displays it as cards in a list.

## Future Plans
This project pulls data about movies' locations and characters to use on their own pages. On those pages, when a card is clicked, you get a view of the movies from which they are featured.
